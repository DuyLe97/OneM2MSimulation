# OneM2MSimulation

Simulation OneM2M is an application that allows users to perform IN, MN, AE nodes on the interface. 
Users can start nodes IN, MN, AE with the interface. 
Add, edit, delete nodes, monitor the communication between nodes. 
Subscribe to the message content between nodes.

# Getting Started:

1. Setup java platform to run OneM2M
2. Download the Visual Studio.
3. Install the Visual Studio follow the guide.
4. Open the OneM2MSimulation home and double click simulation.sln file.

# Running:

1. Press the F5 key in Visual studio or click the start button on top of Visual studio IDE.
2. In the interface of simulationFile > New > Create. Enter the print quantity IN, MN, AE you want to perform.
3. You can configure the parameters of nodes such as: Node Name, Port, ID, IP of each node by duplicate clicking on the node you want to edit (otherwise edit node will be given default parameters).
4. After set parameters successfully. Click the RUN button to start the program. And monitor the process of sending and receiving messages on the monitor on the right of the application
5. You can add and delete nodes while simulation is running by going to Motes > Add node / Delete node on the toolbar.

# Development:

The OneM2MSimulation is developed base on Windows Forms Application.
So the UI part and logic part is written with C#.
The software will better serve the purpose of researching on OneM2M. So you can download the source code and improve the functionality to suit your intended use.
